Data includes spawner-recruit data for all Fraser Sockeye stocks with available data, that rear in freshwater for for two winters (Harrison stock removed).

Potential environmental covariates are also included, which are generally assumed to affect early-marine survival, so are synced with each brood-years outmigration year and approximate timing.

Warm-up assignment for Day 1 can be found in "Intro to SR Data.qmd" file, while the main management ask can be found in "Forecasting assignment.qmd".
